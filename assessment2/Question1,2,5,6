Ans 1.
ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping. It is used to maintain a relationship between object and relational database.
It is used to map object data model into relational data model. Mapping allows us to store and read data from database.
When we use object oriented programming there is a mismatch between object model and relational model because object oriented model uses class and relational model uses table this is why orm was introduced to overcome this mismatch.

There are 4 types of mapping:
1. One-to-one - Only one entity is related to another one entity. Ex - a person can have only one id number.
2. One-to-many - One entity is related to many entities. Ex - a person can have many phone numbers.
3. Many-to-one - Many entities can be related to only one entity. Ex - different employees can have only one company.
4. Many-to-many - Many entities can ve related to other different entities. Ex - many students can have various different subjects.
